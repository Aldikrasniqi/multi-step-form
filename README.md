## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Next with Typescript and React
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React Context API for state management

### What I learned

- Challenged myself to manage the state only with the React Context API, without using any other state management library like Redux or Zustand.

### Continued development

If I had more time, I would like to add unit tests, e2e tests and also add some animations to the form.

### Useful resources

- [Context API](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html) - I used this documentation to understand some misconceptions about the Context API.
